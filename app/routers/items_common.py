"""Item helpers shared by the item routers and by services.

`app/routers/items.py` was 2,481 lines and 30 routes — 38% of all router code,
flagged for splitting in two separate code reviews and growing +135 lines
between them. It is now four modules: this one plus `items_covers.py`,
`items_csv.py` and `items_catalog.py`.

What lives here is what more than one of them needs — metadata lookup, the
save path, cover resolution, the scan log — plus the pieces other packages
already reached into `items.py` for (`SORT_OPTIONS` for `pages.py`,
`resolve_missing_cover` for `services/cover_queue.py`, `_log_scan` and
`_save_item` for `store.py` and `intake.py`).

Import the *module* and call through it (`resolve_missing_cover(...)`)
rather than `from ... import resolve_missing_cover`. Tests patch these by
attribute, and a from-import binds a copy that patching cannot reach.
